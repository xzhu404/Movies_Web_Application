The effects are impressive, so are the vast amount of easter eggs. It's so delightful how great the humor is among with how lovely the dancing bits are. I am glad James Gunn helmed such a precious project and happy to own on Blu-Ray eventually I want the 4K of it.",2020-10-01 14:31:26
2,1,1,"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness.",2020-10-02 14:39:51

The film is strong on so many levels, outstanding characters, great worlds, is emotional and humorous.",2020-10-03 08:12:08
